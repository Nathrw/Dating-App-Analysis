Dating App Analysis: Date-A-Scientist
Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth exploration and analysis of user data from the dating application OKCupid. The primary objective is to utilize data science techniques, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning, to identify user patterns and build predictive models based on profile characteristics.

Objectives
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing demographics such as age, orientation, and education to understand the user base.

Machine Learning: Implementing classification or regression models to predict specific attributes like zodiac signs, income levels, or education based on other profile features.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling null values, and converting categorical data into numerical formats suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Technical Components
Language: Python.

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

Environment: Jupyter Notebook (date-a-scientist_(final).ipynb).

Dataset Information
The analysis is performed on the dataset "profiles (1).csv". This file contains data for approximately 60,000 users and includes various features such as:

Demographics: Age, sex, and orientation.

Lifestyle Factors: Diet, drinking habits, smoking, and drug use.

Personal Details: Job, education, ethnicity, and zodiac sign.

Note: Due to the file size (approx. 152 MB), this dataset is managed via Git Large File Storage (LFS) to maintain repository efficiency.
